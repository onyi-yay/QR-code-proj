# QR code component solution

Hello, this is my first readme document, so pardon me if I made some errors. Thanks!

# Responsive QR Code Project

This project demonstrates a responsive QR code card using HTML and CSS. The card includes a QR code image, a title, and a descriptive paragraph.

 It adjusts its layout to be mobile-friendly using CSS media queries. (I don't know about this but I really tried to get it relatively close to 'mobile-friendly' to no avail)
